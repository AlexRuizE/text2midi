text2midi
=========

Text to midi converter. This program asks the user for a text file, which is parsed into sentences. Each token is mapped with a simple cypher to a set of simultaneous notes (chords). The resulting file is a .mid file that can be used as rythmic and melodic input for various soft-synths or drum racks.
